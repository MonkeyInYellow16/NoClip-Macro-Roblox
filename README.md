Roblox NoClip Macro (R6 & R15)
This is a custom AutoHotkey-based macro system I created for NoClipping in Roblox. It includes 4 macros total:

2 R6 NoClips

2 R15 NoClips

⚠️ Make sure to use the correct character model macro with the correlating game

🧠 About
This macro works best with tall avatars, which you can create using only free Roblox avatar items—the ones I tested with were all free. For R15 NoClip macros to function properly, you'll need two specific emotes:

"Salute" Emote → Assign to Slot 1 on your Emote Wheel

"Tilt" Emote → Assign to Slot 2 on your Emote Wheel

Both emotes are free and can be found in the Roblox avatar shop.

🎮 How to Use
Equip a tall avatar (taller avatars work best for consistency).

Assign the required emotes:

"Salute" → Emote Wheel Slot 1

"Tilt" → Emote Wheel Slot 2

Load into a game with walls you want to NoClip through.

Enable Shift Lock.

Face your character close up to a wall.

Run the macro and observe which direction shift lock pushes you.

Adjust your character’s orientation as needed and retry until you pass through.

📦 Included Macros
R6_NoClip_1

R6_NoClip_2

R15_NoClip_Tilt

R15_NoClip_Salute

Each macro can be assigned to its own hotkey via the macro GUI included in the system.

🛠️ Requirements
Windows (for AutoHotkey support)

AutoHotkey installed (https://www.autohotkey.com/)

Basic understanding of how to run AHK scripts

❗Tips
Make sure Shift Lock is turned on in your Roblox settings.

Try different orientations if the macro doesn’t work right away.

Not all games or walls behave the same—experiment and adjust positioning as needed.
