# Roblox NoClip Macro (R6 & R15)

This is a custom AutoHotkey-based macro system I created for NoClipping in Roblox. It includes 4 macros total:

- ✅ 2 R6 NoClips  
- ✅ 2 R15 NoClips  

⚠️ **Make sure to use the correct character model macro with the correlating game.**

## 🧠 About

This macro works best with **tall avatars**, which you can create using only **free Roblox avatar items** — the ones I tested with were all free.

For **R15 NoClip macros** to function properly, you’ll need two specific **free** emotes:

- 🎖️ **“Salute”** → Assign to **Slot 1** on your Emote Wheel  
- 🎯 **“Tilt”** → Assign to **Slot 2** on your Emote Wheel

You can find both emotes in the [Roblox Avatar Shop](https://www.roblox.com/catalog).

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Equip a **tall avatar** (for best results).
2. Assign the required emotes:
   - **Salute** → Emote Wheel **Slot 1**
   - **Tilt** → Emote Wheel **Slot 2**
3. Load into a game with walls you want to NoClip through.
4. Enable **Shift Lock** in your Roblox settings.
5. Get your character **close up to a wall**.
6. Run the macro.
7. Watch which direction Shift Lock pushes you.
8. Adjust your character’s orientation as needed.
9. Retry until you pass through.

Each macro can be assigned to its own **hotkey via the included GUI**.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [AutoHotkey 2.0+](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed

---

## ❗ Tips

- ✅ Make sure **Shift Lock** is turned on in your Roblox settings
- 🔄 If the macro doesn’t work right away, try **adjusting your angle or position**
- 🧱 Not all games or walls behave the same — **experiment a little** to get it just right
